# ScrollNavBarAppear

## A navigation bar that shows/hides when user scrolls.##
Need **to be improved and disengaged** from controller in order to allow the dev use it in multiple controllers in an easy way.
Some solutions we found arround the web were hierarchy dependant or added to much code due to customization.
We were looking for a navigation bar animation to be used in a new design so **we made this as a test**.
